# HTML Projects

Welcome to my **HTML Projects** repository!  

This repository contains small  projects built using **pure HTML**, aimed at transforming my learning into real-world development practice. Each project is structured to demonstrate clear semantic HTML, proper element usage, and accessible design principles.  

---

## 📂 Project Structure

Each project follows this pattern:
Project-Name/
├── index.html # The main HTML file
└── README.md # Short description of the project

---

## 🚀 Goals of this Repository

- Apply HTML concepts learned in a real development context.
- Practice semantic and accessible HTML structure.
- Build a portfolio of mini-projects from beginner to advanced level.
- Prepare for integrating CSS and JavaScript in future projects.

## 📝 Current Projects
